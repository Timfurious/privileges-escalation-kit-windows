The unquoted_service_path vulnerability is a flaw related to services that use file paths without quotation marks. For example:
C:\Program File\Wondershare Filmora\Wondershare.exe
In this case, Windows will try to execute multiple paths in order:
First, it will attempt to run C:\Program.exe (which usually doesn't exist), then C:\Program File\Wondershare.exe, and finally the intended executable C:\Program File\Wondershare Filmora\Wondershare.exe.

Now, imagine we place a reverse shell at C:\Program File\Wondershare.exe — this is where the vulnerability lies. Because these services often run with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges, exploiting this path confusion can lead to privilege escalation.

Below, you’ll find a PowerShell listener and a reverse shell written in C that allows you to spawn a shell on 127.0.0.1 at port 4444 with the source code.
